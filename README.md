## The Repository

This repository is where I create a Work Day Planner using JQuery and Bootstrap.

When you click the live link above, you will be able to input any text into the timeslot desired for the hour. Saving your task with the blue save button on the right side will ensure you don't lose track of what you need to do that day! 
As well the time slots are color coded to let you know what time slots have passed already, current or are in the future!
